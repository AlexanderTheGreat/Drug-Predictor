# Drug-Predictor
Determines if a particular compound is active (1) or not (0). Useful for drug researchers tasked with determining what separates the active (binding) compounds from the inactive (non-binding) ones. F1-Score of 0.65.

To perform this tasked I tested three different classifiers: decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector machine. The best performing classifier, with an F-Score of 0.65, was the decision tree classifier.
